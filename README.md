## Hi there 👋


### Hi, I'm Chandan Kumar 👋

I'm someone who likes to keep it simple — but sharp.  
Right now, I'm diving deeper into code, logic, and real problem-solving.

---

🧠 What I'm into:
- Writing clean code (C, Python, Git)
- Learning by building (projects, not just plans)
- Keeping things minimal and real

🛠️ Currently exploring:
- Core electronics + logic
- Version control, open source basics
- Systems that *actually* work

> No noise. Just progress.
